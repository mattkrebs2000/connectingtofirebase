This Repository includes an Application that is connected to Firebase --- Traversy's ToDo App.

It also includes two other two-do Apps. You must choose one of them and connect the CRUD functions to Firebase. 


The video for this first App is at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8kYlimhuLw


The video for this second App is at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1E08i2UJGI


Links for the repos for both of these can be found in the Descriptions of their YouTube Videos. 

Please note the "Public" folder seems to be missing from the second of the two video example repos. If you clone it and get an error AND you don't see the "public" folder you can copy it from another React Repo and the App should work. 

Requirements for this homework assignment. 

    1. You must choose either of these two Repos. Retain the "look" of the App. But add Firebase -include (or change existing) functions which help to Create, Read, Update, and Delete in the Firebase Database.  Becasue the App will be conncted to a Firebase Database, the data for the App should surive from one use to another. 

    I highly recommend that you use Functional Components and Hooks. In my experience, this kind of code is more "Forgiving" than are Class Components code. 

    2. Watch the last 5 minutes of this Video and try to deploy your Firebase App to the web: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1E08i2UJGI
