Requirements for this homework assignment. 

    1. Retain the "look" of the ToDo App. But add Firebase -include (or change existing) functions which help to Create, Read, Update, and Delete in the Firebase Database.  Becasue the App will be conncted to a Firebase Database, the data for the App should survive from one use to another. 

    2. Watch the following video and follow the steps to deploy your repository to the web: https://youtu.be/4zWBHbTW0BU

    3. Pass in a link to your repository and the url of the deployed app.
